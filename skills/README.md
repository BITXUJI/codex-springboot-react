# Skills

Project-specific Codex skills live here.

## Structure
- Each skill is a folder with a required `SKILL.md`.

## Adding a skill
- Create a new folder under `skills/`.
- Add `SKILL.md` with the skill metadata and instructions.
- Keep skill folders minimal; avoid extra docs unless required by the skill.
